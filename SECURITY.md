# Enterprise IT Onboarding Automation Suite - Security Notes

## üîí Security Implementation

### Password Management
- **Temporary Passwords**: Generated using cryptographically secure random generation
- **Password Strength**: Minimum 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and special characters
- **Encryption**: All passwords encrypted at rest using Fernet encryption
- **Rotation**: Automatic password change required on first login

### Access Control
- **IP Filtering**: Configurable IP allow/block lists
- **Session Management**: 8-hour session timeout with automatic cleanup
- **Role-Based Access**: Department-based permissions and group assignments
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all system activities

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- **Secure Storage**: Credentials stored in environment variables
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: SSL/TLS required in production environments
- **Data Retention**: Configurable data retention policies

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Environment Configuration
1. **Never commit credentials to version control**
2. **Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts**
3. **Regularly rotate service account passwords**
4. **Enable MFA for all administrative accounts**
5. **Use dedicated service accounts for automation**

### Network Security
1. **Restrict access to management interfaces**
2. **Use VPN for remote administration**
3. **Implement network segmentation**
4. **Monitor network traffic for anomalies**
5. **Regular security updates and patches**

### Application Security
1. **Regular security audits and penetration testing**
2. **Input validation and sanitization**
3. **SQL injection prevention**
4. **Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection**
5. **Regular dependency updates**

## üîê Credential Management

### Service Accounts
- **AD Service Account**: Dedicated account with minimal required permissions
- **O365 Service Account**: Application-specific credentials with limited scope
- **SMTP Account**: Dedicated email account for notifications
- **Database Access**: Encrypted connection strings

### Permission Requirements

#### Active Directory
- Create user accounts in specified OUs
- Add users to security groups
- Set user attributes and properties
- Manage group memberships

#### Office 365
- Exchange Online management
- User mailbox provisioning
- Distribution list management
- Mailbox quota configuration

#### File System
- Create and manage shared folders
- Set folder permissions
- Configure folder redirection
- Manage drive mappings
