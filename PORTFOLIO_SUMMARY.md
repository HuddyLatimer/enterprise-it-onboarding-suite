## üíª Technical Implementation Details

### Database Design
```sql
-- Core Tables
- employees (id, employee_id, personal_info, department, status_flags)
- equipment (id, employee_id, type, brand, model, serial_number)
- onboarding_logs (id, employee_id, action, status, timestamp, details)
- users (id, username, email, role, permissions)
- audit_logs (id, user_id, action, timestamp, ip_address)
```

### API Endpoints
```python
# Core Employee Management
GET    /api/employees              # List all employees
POST   /api/employees             # Create new employee
GET    /api/employees/{id}        # Get employee details
PUT    /api/employees/{id}        # Update employee
DELETE /api/employees/{id}        # Delete employee

# Onboarding Automation
POST   /api/onboard/{id}          # Start onboarding process
GET    /api/onboard/{id}/status   # Get onboarding status
POST   /api/onboard/{id}/equipment # Assign equipment

# Analytics & Reporting
GET    /api/analytics/dashboard   # Dashboard statistics
GET    /api/analytics/departments # Department analytics
GET    /api/export/csv           # Export employee data
```

### Security Implementation
```python
# JWT Authentication
@app.route('/api/auth/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    # Validate credentials
    # Generate JWT token
    # Set secure cookies
    # Log authentication attempt

# Role-Based Access Control
@require_permission('employee.create')
def create_employee():
    # Check user permissions
    # Validate input data
    # Create employee record
    # Log action for audit
```
